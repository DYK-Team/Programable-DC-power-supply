# Programable DC power supply based on Arduino UNO WiFi Rev2

In the realm of test and measurement, the concept of software-defined instrumentation is revolutionizing how we design and implement laboratory equipment. Our programmable DC power supply, built on an Arduino UNO and a DAC, exemplifies this paradigm shift. By leveraging software-defined instrumentation principles, we deliver a versatile, cost-effective solution that integrates multiple functions into a single reconfigurable device. By simply uploading different Arduinoâ€™s sketches, users can easily reconfigure the device for various tasks, including integrating sensors. This approach enhances flexibility, simplifies maintenance, and ensures adaptability to evolving technological demands.
