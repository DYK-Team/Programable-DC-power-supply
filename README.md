# Programable DC power supply based on Arduino UNO WiFi Rev2

In the realm of test and measurement, the concept of software-defined instrumentation is revolutionizing how we design and implement laboratory equipment. Our programmable DC power supply, built on an Arduino UNO and a DAC, exemplifies this paradigm shift. By leveraging software-defined instrumentation principles, we deliver a versatile, cost-effective solution that integrates multiple functions into a single reconfigurable device. By simply uploading different Arduinoâ€™s sketches, users can easily reconfigure the device for various tasks, including integrating sensors. This approach enhances flexibility, simplifies maintenance, and ensures adaptability to evolving technological demands.

For detailed information about the project, refer to the report in the file "Programable DC power supply based on Arduino UNO.pdf". The Arduino sketch can be found in the "Voltage_Red_Black_Outputs" folder. The control program in Python, "main.py", uses the library function "Volt_Red_Black_Out.py". In addition, we have included the sketches and programs used during the debugging process of the device. They are located in the "Test_Sketches_Arduino_Python" folder. Photographs of the project stages are saved in the "Design gallery" folder.

The report provides a detailed discussion of the applications of the programmable power supply for magneto-impedance measurements, along with the relevant references. The power supply was specifically designed for these applications but can be easily reprogrammed for other laboratory tasks.
